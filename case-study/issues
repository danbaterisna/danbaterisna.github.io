			<h2> In Use and Extraction </h2>
			<p>	There are several documented cases in relation to the risks involved in the extraction of gold. According to Eisler (2003), health complications that are occur prevalently to miners are short life expectancy, cancer in the respiratory tract, stomach and liver; pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), lung fibrosis due to inhalation of silica, and congestive heart failure. Poor working conditions in excavation sites result to malaria and dengue fever; hearing loss; bacterial and viral diseases; and diseases of the blood, skin, and musculoskeletal system. Studies document these health complications especially in Australia, North America, South America, and Africa. Miners  who are frequently exposed to mercury and amalgamate for extraction most probably have mercury contamination. Among individuals exposed occupationally, exceeding amounts of mercury used in the extraction of gold violate all proposed health criterias proposed by international agencies.</p>
			<p>	In Benguet, the frequent use of mercury and cyanide in ore processing become the root cause of several health hazards. These miners have little regard even for the use of basic safety equipment. Moreover, children who partake in labor are also subjected to these health hazards. Communities nearby mining sites are also heavily affected by the pollution. Since small scale mining in Benguet rarely use recent technology in excavating, tunnels have poor ventilation. Body odors from the workers and sooty smoke from torches contribute to a subhuman working condition.</p> 
			<p> Considering that these small scale miners depend heavily on their livelihood, they are given no other choice but to be exposed to health hazards everyday. In an interview with a 60 year old small scale miner from Barangay Ucab in Itogon, Benguet in the Cordillera region, he stated that he had no knowledge to pursue any other means of livelihood expect for mining. “'Yun talaga ang trabaho namin, wala akong ibang alam na trabaho. Ginagawa ng mga magulang ko, siya ang ginaya ko rin na trabaho nila. Hindi naman ako nakapag-aral eh," Waclin said.</p>
			<p> Moreover, the gold extractive industry have contributed to environmental degradation and it is extremely unavoidable to mitigate the effects since the demand for gold is still very high. An effect of gol extraction is the amount or erosion it leaves on ground surface. Construction of tunnels result to destabilizing of slopes and worsening of effects of natural disasters. An estimated 26 t of mercury is disposed to main bodies of water near mining vicinities. Denudation of forests also results loss of animal habitats. (Dangla, 2017)</p>
			<h2> In Depletion </h2>
			<p> According to Sun Star Baguio (2017), the high demand for mining stocks recognized Baguio as a full fledged mining district and propagated the whole community. The companies investing on the mining sites subsidized the construction of public infrastractures and roads and propagated the aviation and shipping industry. With the probability of depletion in the future since gold is a non-renewable resource, the economy in Baguio might also be directly affected. Since locals are heavily reliant to the supply of gold to support their everyday living, they would have to resort to another livelihood more sustainable than gold mining. Considering the fact that most these locals are completely oblivious to other forms of livelihood and that they did not acquire a formal education, it will be a challenge to settle. Furthermore, Small-scale miners in Itogon are concerned that their livelihood might be affected by Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) Secretary Gina Lopez opposition to mining. The government also has its prominent role to lessen environmental degradation in the area and slow down the inevitable depletion of gold. This can be viewed positively, however locals who work as small scale miners say otherwise. Hence, the depletion of gold will result to several detrimental factors especially to the livelihood of gold miners in the area together with corporations who set up excavation sites.</p>
			<h2> In Legislature </h2>
			<p> In the Philippine setting, laws have been enacted to lessen environmental degradation  and to provide more opportunities to small scale miners. The Philippine Mining Act  of 1995 serves as the foundation of all preceding laws regarding mining. It provides strict adherence to the principle of sustainable development. The Mines and Geosciences Bureau states that “this strategy mandates that the needs of the present should be met without compromising the ability of the future generations to meet their own needs, with the view of improving the quality of life, both now and in the future. Sustainable development provides that the use of mineral wealth shall be pro-people and pro-environment in sustaining wealth creation and improve quality of life.” This law was met with criticism stating that  the mining act gave a viable excuse to exploit the environment in the Philippines and to displace residents living in potential mining sites. Human rights of indigenous people are not taken into consideration since it could be inferred that their rights to ancestral domains and natural resources will be swept aside. (CPA Phils, 2015)</p>
			<p> The Presidential Decree No. 1150 issued by Ferdinand Marcos acknowledged “highgrading" or the theft of gold from a mining claim or mining camp which is a serious problem affecting both the gold mining industry and the government. It also states that it is necessary to regulate or prohibit certain acts or activities, among which are gold 'panning' or 'sluicing' in public or private lands, and the use or possession of raw gold, gold amalgam, or mercury within a mining claim or mining camp. (Robles).</p>
			<p>The provisions of Republic Act No. 7076, or the People’s Small-scale Mining Act of 1991, require the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas [BSP] to maintain a gold buying-and-selling program for small-scale miners. It maintains buying stations in Baguio, Quezon City, and 3 other cities. After refining the gold obtained, it is sold in the international bullion market. (BSP, 2015) This program, however, faces challenges with regards to smuggling, partly due to the taxes imposed upon the program. In 2011, the amount of gold purchased in Q3 dropped by 76%, from 7,166 kg to 1,722 kg. This drop in activity came “at a time when central banks worldwide are stepping up gold purchases to boost their reserves” (Alave, 2001). However, in late 2017, the creditable withholding tax on gold sales was lowered from 5% to 1%, which, combined with low assay and processing fees, would entice local gold miners to commit to the BSP program. Later on, in early 2018, the Department of Finance [DOF] said that small-scale miners from the Cordilleras have committed to the government initiative, citing purchases worth P1.2 million in January 2018. If this trend continues, government agencies will be able to effectively funnel and harness responsibly sourced local gold resources to aid our economy. Overall, many laws have been enacted in accordance to mining in the Philippines.</p>
